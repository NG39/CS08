##Setting up the project

1. Install and run a redis server:
    1. `sudo apt-get install redis-server`
    2. `redis-server --daemonize yes`
2. `cd myApp`
3. Run sapper:
    1. `cd sapper`
    2. Install npm dependencies: `npm install`
    3. Run: `npm run dev`
    4. Verify it's running by going to `http://localhost:3000`
4. Start the Prisma server
    1. Install prisma: `npm install -g prisma`
    2. Make sure docker is set up (follow the [instructions on their website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))
    3. `cd db`
    4. Install npm dependencies: `npm install`
    5. Start docker: `docker-compose up -d`
        1. If working with `Docker Desktop` on Windows 10 PRO use `endpoint: http://localhost:4466` in prisma.yml. If  using Toolbox or prisma doesn't connect use `endpoint: http://192.168.99.100:4466`
    6. Deploy and generate prisma: `prisma deploy; prisma generate`
    7. Install database dependencies: `npm install`
    7. Start the GraphQL server: `node index.js`
    8. Verify prisma is running by going to `http://localhost:4000` (you should see a GraphQL playground)
        1. You can now also go to `http://localhost:4466` to access the internal prisma GraphQL playground
        2. You can access the prisma admin panel at `http://localhost:4466/_admin`
